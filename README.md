# Exploration of C# Programming Language

## Programming Language and Version
C# (C Sharp), version 9.0

## Why C#?
C# was chosen due to its popularity, robustness, and versatility. It is widely used for developing various types of applications, including web applications, desktop applications, games, and mobile apps. Additionally, C# integrates seamlessly with the .NET framework, providing access to a vast array of libraries and tools.

## Language Features

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
C# fully supports object-oriented programming paradigms, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Classes and objects can be defined to model real-world entities, with properties, methods, and other members.

### File Ingestion
File ingestion is handled using the `System.IO` namespace, which provides classes and methods for reading from and writing to files. In the provided code, file ingestion is demonstrated using `File.ReadAllLines()` to read data from a CSV file.

### Conditional Statements
C# supports conditional statements such as `if`, `else if`, and `else` for decision-making. These statements allow developers to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions.

### Assignment Statements
Assignment statements in C# are straightforward and follow the conventional syntax, with the assignment operator (`=`) used to assign values to variables.

### Loops
C# supports various types of loops, including `for`, `foreach`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. These loops enable developers to iterate over collections, execute code repeatedly until a condition is met, or perform iterative tasks.

### Subprograms (Functions/Methods)
C# allows the definition of methods/functions within classes to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. Methods can have parameters and return values, facilitating modular and maintainable code.

### Unit Testing
Unit testing in C# is typically performed using frameworks such as NUnit, MSTest, or xUnit. These frameworks provide a way to write and execute automated tests to validate the functionality of individual units (e.g., methods, classes) of code.

### Exception Handling
C# supports robust exception handling mechanisms using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks. Exceptions can be caught, handled, and logged to ensure graceful error recovery and application stability.

## Libraries Used

1. `System.IO`: Used for file I/O operations, such as reading from and writing to files.
2. `System.Linq`: Provides a set of extension methods for querying collections using Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax.
3. `System.Collections.Generic`: Offers generic collection classes like lists, dictionaries, and queues for storing and manipulating data efficiently.

These libraries were chosen for their essential functionalities that align with the requirements of the project, including file processing, data manipulation, and LINQ querying.

## Outputs

1. **Number of phones with multiple features/sensors:** 568
2. **Number of phones announced in one year but released in another:** 0
3. **Number of phones with only one feature/sensor:** 433
4. **Year with the most phones launched (after 1999):** 2019 (304 phones)
5. **Company with the highest average weight of the phone body:** OEM
